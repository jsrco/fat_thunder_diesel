                    I have been meaning to create this site for a couple of
                    weeks now. <br /><br />
                    I recently had a baby girl. During the delivery there were complications.<br
                    /><br />
                    A rough epidural, a broken vacuum, and an overhead view of an
                    episiotomy... shit hit the fan for baby's first moments.
                    <br /><br />

                        <img
                            class="max-h-96 m-auto rounded-lg"
                            src="./assets/n1.png"
                            alt="Nadja"
                        />

                            class="m-auto text-center text-gray-400 text-sm"
                        >
                            "Relax, I am fine." Nadja said.

                    We spent 10 days in the NICU at a different hospital.The first
                    day there, she stopped breathing while I was holding her hand.
                    That was a lot to deal with.<br />
                    <br />
                    Plus, you aren't alone in the NICU. You are there with other
                    families. There was a baby born at 23 weeks in the ward. It's
                    a massive amount of emotion and information to be around.
                    <br /><br />
                    To say the least, my focus and mojo have gone to shit. I can't
                    meditate or shoot my bow. Trying to work happens.<br /><br
                    />
                    It's like I lost my connection with, everything.

                    My back up is going for a run or walk in the woods. But the weather
                    out here hasn't been stellar.<br /><br />
                    It feels pretty close to getting popped in the nose and stunned
                    when boxing. It takes a bit to realign your perception and understand
                    that you got smacked in the face.
                    <br /><br />
                    In aftermath of a traumatic event, I am curious how people deal.
                    How do you deal with these kinds of major events that leave you
                    reeling?<br /><br />
                    Even with excitement from those first 10 days, it has been the
                    most positive experience of my life. <br /><br />
                    And its inspiring.<br /><br />

                    As I rush back to productivity, "fully inspired", I realize I
                    had seen my wife's vagina snipped open by scissors too. Almost
                    a process of rediscovery and hitting a brick wall all at once.

                    For the reader, baby and mom are doing amazing. I swear my partner

                    How do you deal with major life changing situations that leave
                    you stunned? What do you do to start picking up the pieces of
                    the aftermath? There isn't a spot for you to respond.
                    <br /><br /> Those thoughts are for you if they mean
                    anything.<br /><br />
                    Going forward, I will begin to connect this site and grow it
                    out. I have a
