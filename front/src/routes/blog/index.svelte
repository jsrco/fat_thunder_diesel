                    After my in-laws staying with us, I am spent. 5 people in a
                    2 bedroom apartment... for 10 days. They do not speak the
                    best English.
                    <br /><br />
                    It hasn't been the most productive environment.
                    <br /><br />
                    To make it more exciting, the day they leave, I get the office
                    back. So I am kind of counting the seconds.
                    <br /><br />
                    Then, the day after that, I start a new job as a Vue Engineer!
                    <br /><br />
                    I will be working with <a href="https://www.evidentchange.org/" target="_blank">

                    I am a bit stunned by that opportunity. If you read my last blog,
                    you can understand why the past 4 months have been a whirlwind.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am owning it. But it feels like I am riding a storm of my own
                    design.
                    <br /><br />
                    So let me focus for a second. This new job is going to allow
                    me to contribute all the things I have been studying, for an
                    amazing cause.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am floored by this. I spent part of the weekend researching
                    my new tech stack. So I am not blind on anything.
                    <br /><br />
                    This will be an amazing opportunity! Logistics, I should be able
                    to keep my daughter at home with Chloe and I. While we both work
                    like vigilantes.
                    <br /><br />
                    Now to the side project,

                    famous last words. I can learn anything because I hyper focus
                    when I am passionate.
                    <br /><br />
                    So how am I going to render now? Well I have been taking a <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">

                    to be more concentrated on work for a bit. But this brings up

                    I *never* do it when I am frustrated. It is a place I go to when
                    I am happy. Not to say I don't run into problems. I do all the
                    time.
                    <br /><br />
                    But I only produce work when my mood is positive. This is a hobby
                    and I want to enjoy myself. Which keeps me passionate about it.
                    <br /><br />
                    I wish I had some words of wisdom on how I got here. Some positive
                    reflection through archery. But there isn't any of this today.
                    I have been struggling to maintain trajectory on everything I
                    chose to engage in.
                    <br /><br />
                    But I am. Like I mentioned, I am owning this! I turned 40 in
                    Dec.
                    <br /><br />
                    I can make things move faster than I ever have. Ride the storm,
                    even if it is full of poop.
